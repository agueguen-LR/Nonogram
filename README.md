# Nonogram

Generates a Nonogram puzzle from an image and attempts to solve it, developped in Java between year 1 and year 2 of University, August 2024.
Nonogram is a logic puzzle also known as Picross, Hanjie, Paint by Numbers, Griddlers, and Pic-a-Pix: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonogram](url)

## RoadMap
Development on this project was stopped by the start of my second year at University, I do not know if I will end up finishing this project.

The code is currently able to generate and display a nonogram puzzle generated from an image (black and white puzzles only)

The auto-solving aspect of the code was stopped mid-development and requires a large overhaul. 

The majority of the solving process is completed, but the code is mostly in one large java file and needs to be re-organised and cleaned up.

The Main class (Nonogram.java) is currently set to immediately solve as much as it can of the Nonogram generated from the image "CatPot_Large.png"

## Tools
Made with a simple Ant project in Netbeans IDE
